# Go-Net
Go net is like the crystal-server repo, currently i am studying secure, advanced and complex HTTP routing with golang using channels, this code repo contains some code i write to practice this.


# example usage 

First create a directory called `Modules` then create a file outside of modules called main.go 

add the source code files in this repo into modules and write the following code. For example the code below uses a Modules dir and impliments the proxy 

```go
package main

import Network "main/Modules"

func main() {
	Network.Proxy()
}

```
